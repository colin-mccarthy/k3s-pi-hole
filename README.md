Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

Some notable features include:

* Password protection
* Detailed graphs and doughnut charts
* Top lists of domains and clients
* A filterable and sortable query log
* Long Term Statistics to view data over user-defined time ranges
* The ability to easily manage and configure Pi-hole features



## Pre Reqs (before you apply the manifests) âš 
In the metallb-configmap.yaml file you need to set the IP ranges to match your network.

```
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - addresses:
      - 192.168.161.204-192.168.161.214
      name: default
      protocol: layer2
    - addresses:
      - 192.168.161.215-192.168.161.224
      name: network-services
      protocol: layer2

```
k3s uses the stable/traefik helm chart to deploy the ingress controller with service type LoadBalancer, and the ports there are hardcoded to 443 and 80.

We will be removing Traefik so our pihole-tcp service can use port 80 on the node instead.

```
$ kubectl get svc -n kube-system
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                                     AGE
kube-dns         ClusterIP      10.43.0.10      <none>            53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP                      14m
metrics-server   ClusterIP      10.43.177.238   <none>            443/TCP                                     14m
traefik          LoadBalancer   10.43.52.84     192.168.161.104   80:32185/TCP,443:31801/TCP,8080:30008/TCP   12m


$ kubectl delete -n kube-system helmcharts traefik
helmchart.helm.cattle.io "traefik" deleted

$ kubectl get svc -n kube-system
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
